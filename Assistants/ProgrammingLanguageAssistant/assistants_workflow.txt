Note: 

1. An assistant should be created at the Project level
	- Determine the project whose assistant you want to create
	- Execute Command: ExtractCsFiles('/path/to/proj/directory')
	- The above command creates artifacts in the current working directory
	- Navigate to the generated artifacts directory and remove any unwanted files. Limit to 20 files at max
2. Execute command: OpenAICreateCsProjectAssistant '/path/to/artifacts/directory'



Steps:
1. Navigate to a directory containing the project you want to create an assistant for
2. Execute command: ExtractCsFiles('/path/to/proj/directory')
	- should generate a directory containing all the .cs files in the project
	- directory should be found in the current working directory with a '_project' suffix
3. Group the generated files by namespace by executing command: GroupCsFilesByNamespace('/path/to/extracted/files/directory')
	- should overwrite the directory containing the extracted files
	- files should be grouped by namespace

4. Execute command: OpenAICreateCsProjectAssistant '/path/to/grouped/files/directory'
	- should generate 'openai_create_project_assistant_output.json' file containing the assistant id
	- should generate 'openai_upload_assistant_files_output.json' file containing the uploaded files
5, An artifact file containing the created assistant will be generated in the current working directory.
6. Generate a Thread Pool by executing command: OpenAICreateAssistantThreadPool <count>
	- count is the number of threads to be created
	- should generate a file containing thread ids

7. Create thread message by generating a message payload:
" {
"	"threadId": "thrd_1GJ5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5",
"	"message": "Hello, I am a message",
"	"file_id": [optional]
" }




6. To delete all uploaded files by the CS Project Assistant, execute command: OpenAIDeleteCsProjectAssistantFiles
'/path/to/uploaded/assistant/files/directory'
7, To Delete all assistant files regardless of the process that created them, execute command: OpenAIDeleteAllAssistantFiles
8. To delete the created assistant, execute command: OpenAIDeleteAssistant 'assistant_id'. The assistant_id is found in the assistant artifact file generated in step 5.

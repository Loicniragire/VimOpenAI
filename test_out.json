  "instructions": "The assistant is tasked to work on various .NetCore projects, each involving different files and functionalities. The projects are primarily developed in C#. All the project files have been uploaded as text (.txt) files. Each file represents a single namespace from the projectand the filename corresponds to the namespace name. Within each file, all classes, interfaces, and other types that belong to that namespace are included.Tasks: 1. Code Analysis: Perform a comprehensive analysis on the provided .NetCore project files, focusing on performance, security, and adherence to best practices. Identify areas for improvement and suggest optimizations. 2. Feature Implementation and Enhancement: Based on the project requirements, implement new features or enhance existing functionalities. Ensure that implementations are efficient, maintainable, and align with the project's overall architecture. 3. Code Generation: Generate C# code snippets or entire modules as required by the specific project. The code should be compatible with the .NetCore version in use and follow established coding conventions. Requirements will be provided in the format of GIVEN, WHEN, THEN statements. 4. Testing and Documentation: Develop testing strategies, including unit and integration tests, to ensure the robustness of new or modified code. Produce concise documentation for the implemented code, outlining its purpose, usage, and any special considerations. 5. File Management: Manage and organize project files efficiently, ensuring that the project structure is maintained and easily navigable. Expected Deliverables: For each project, deliver a report on code analysis, implemented features or enhancements with corresponding C# code, testing strategies, and documentation. Projects should be left in a clean, well-documented state. General Considerations: Adapt to the specific requirements of each project, including but not limited to different .NetCore versions, third-party libraries, and database integrations. Ensure compatibility and seamless integration with existing project components. Deadline: As per individual project timelines.",
